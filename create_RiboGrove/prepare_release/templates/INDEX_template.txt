== discarded_sequences.fasta.gz ==

This is a fasta file of sequences which were present in source RefSeq genomes and were annotated as 16S rRNA genes but which have been discarded according to their incompleteness, internal repeats etc. and thus haven't been included into RiboGrove.


== source_RefSeq_genomes.tsv ==

This is a TSV file which contains information about what genomes were used for the RiboGrove construction. This file is derived from assembly summaries and is a subset thereof (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/assembly_summary.txt and https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/archaea/assembly_summary.txt).

Columns in this file are the same as in source assembly summary files. There is only one difference: in `source_RefSeq_genomes.tsv`, column `assembly_accession` is renamed to `asm_acc` for brevity. Column descriptions are completely adopted from the file `ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/README_assembly_summary.txt`.

Column descriptions:

- Column `asm_acc`: Assembly accession: the assembly accession.version reported in this field is 
   a unique identifier for the set of sequences in this particular version of 
   the genome assembly.
- Column `taxid`: Taxonomy ID: the NCBI taxonomy identifier for the organism from which the 
   genome assembly was derived. The NCBI Taxonomy Database is a curated 
   classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public 
   sequence databases. The taxonomy record can be retrieved from the NCBI 
   Taxonomy resource:
   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/
- Column `species_taxid`: Species taxonomy ID: the NCBI taxonomy identifier for the species from which 
   the genome assembly was derived. The species taxid will differ from the 
   organism taxid (column 6) only when the organism was reported at a sub-
   species or strain level.
- Column `organism_name`: Organism name: the scientific name of the organism from which the sequences 
   in the genome assembly were derived. This name is taken from the NCBI 
   Taxonomy record for the taxid specified in column 6. Some older taxids were 
   assigned at the strain level and for these the organism name will include the
   strain. Current practice is only to assign taxids at the species level; for 
   these the organism name will be just the species, however, the strain name 
   will be reported in the infraspecific_name field (column 9).
- Column `infraspecific_name`: Infraspecific name: the strain, breed, cultivar or ecotype of the organism 
   from which the sequences in the genome assembly were derived. Data are 
   reported in the form tag=value, e.g. strain=AF16. Strain, breed, cultivar 
   and ecotype are not expected to be used together, however, if they are then 
   they will be reported in a list separated by ", /". Empty if no strain, 
   breed, cultivar or ecotype is specified on the genomic sequence records.
- Column `assembly_level`: Assembly level: the highest level of assembly for any object in the genome 
   assembly.
   Values:
      Complete genome - all chromosomes are gapless and have no runs of 10 or 
                        more ambiguous bases (Ns), there are no unplaced or 
                        unlocalized scaffolds, and all the expected chromosomes
                        are present (i.e. the assembly is not noted as having 
                        partial genome representation). Plasmids and organelles
                        may or may not be included in the assembly but if 
                        present then the sequences are gapless.
      Chromosome      - there is sequence for one or more chromosomes. This 
                        could be a completely sequenced chromosome without gaps
                        or a chromosome containing scaffolds or contigs with 
                        gaps between them. There may also be unplaced or 
                        unlocalized scaffolds.
      Scaffold        - some sequence contigs have been connected across gaps to
                        create scaffolds, but the scaffolds are all unplaced or 
                        unlocalized.
      Contig          - nothing is assembled beyond the level of sequence 
                        contigs
- Column `genome_rep`: Genome representation: whether the goal for the assembly was to represent the
   whole genome or only part of it.
   Values:
      Full    - the data used to generate the assembly was obtained from the 
                whole genome, as in Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assemblies for 
                example. There may still be gaps in the assembly.
      Partial - the data used to generate the assembly came from only part of 
                the genome. 
   Most assemblies have full genome representation with a minority being partial
   genome representation. See the Assembly help web page 
   (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/) for reasons that the genome 
   representation would be set to partial.
- Column `seq_rel_date`: Sequence release date: the date the sequences in the genome assembly were 
   released in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration 
   (INSDC) databases, i.e. DDBJ, ENA or GenBank.
- Column `asm_name`: Assembly name: the submitter's name for the genome assembly, when one was 
   provided, otherwise a default name, in the form ASM#####v#, is provided by 
   NCBI. Assembly names are not unique.
- Column `submitter`: Submitter: the submitting consortium or first position if a list of 
   organizations. The full submitter information is available in the NCBI 
   BioProject resource: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/
